# Unprioritized Roadmap

- [ ] add a file selector to load a new HDF5 file
- [x] add JPEG and PNG viewer widget (plugin)
- [ ] add object information: type, number of attributes, path (e.g. /versions/format_version)
- [x] add hex viewer widget
- [ ] add markdown viewer for datasets that contain markdown text (maybe leave this as a plugin?)
- [ ] configuration options, e.g. which plugins to use/enable
